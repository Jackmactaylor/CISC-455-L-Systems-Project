# CISC-455-L-Systems-Project

The code repository can be found here: https://github.com/Jackmactaylor/CISC-455-L-Systems-Project
To execute the code you may either run the Demo "L-Systems.exe" in the Demo Build folder (you must download the entire Demo Build folder, not just the L-Systems.exe) included in the base repository or install Unity 2019.4.40f1 within
Unity Hub and clone the GitHub repository.

Step by step instructions are provided for clarity.

(1) Download GitHub Desktop and login using a GitHub account
(2) In top left click "Add", clone repository using the link https://github.com/Jackmactaylor/CISC-455-L-SystemsProject
(3) Fetch the project at the top once selected
(4) Download Unity Hub
(5) Install 2019.4.40f1, goto Installs->Install Editor->Archive->download archive and find 2019.4.40f1, it will open
back in Unity Hub
(6) In Unity Hub open the project from where you cloned the Repository in GitHub Desktop
(7) It will take a while initially to import and solve everything but it will only happen once
(8) Within Unity you should open the scene "V2 Test" under Assets/Scenes/V2 Test"
(9) All relevant simulation settings can be found by clicking on the "SimulationManager" or "EvolutionManager"
objects in the Hierarchy (usually on the left side) and looking in the Inspector tab (usually on the right side)
The Demo build is included for ease of access and novelty purposes (controls are shown in the bottom left, there
is no way to close it other than alt+F4) but access to the full range of tune-able parameters used for modifying the
simulation is only possible within Unity. It is also important to note that caution should be used when running auto
simulation for more than a few days on lower end machines, the memory required to run the simulation is very large
and it can sometimes lock up the entire computer. Manually iterating through the hours is recommended unless you
are collecting data
